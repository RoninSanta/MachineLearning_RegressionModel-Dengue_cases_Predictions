# Machine Learning Regression Model- Dengue Prediction
A machine learning regression model trained using dengue datasets from Singapore to visualize the data and make accurate predictions.

- The dataset is obtained from a Singapore Government Agency Website website called [Data.gov](https://beta.data.gov.sg/), there you can find statistics regarding topics and real-time api and it's all open-sourced free forever, for commercial or personal use. The dataset I downloaded is called "Weekly Number of Dengue and Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever Cases" and can be found [HERE](https://beta.data.gov.sg/datasets/d_ac1eecf0886ff0bceefbc51556247015/view)
- I have also `web-scrapped` from various records to get a more comprehensive info of Weekly dengue infection records from sources such as the National Environmental Agency(NEA), also the mean temperature and rainfall values in Singapore from [WeatherSpark.com](https://weatherspark.com/y/114655/Average-Weather-in-Singapore-Year-Round).
